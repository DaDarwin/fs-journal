# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another. Tasks can run simultaneously. Synchronous is a blocking architecture, so the execution of each operation depends on completing the one before it

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  REST (Representational state transfer) is a software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the World Wide Web. REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of a distributed, Internet-scale hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > connect delete get

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > application Programming Interface

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > make it async

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?
